            Sox's Legacy
        </h1>
        <p>This is a test website I hope to generate into a entire website for the most incredible kitty named Sox,
            he has since passed away.<br>So what better way to celebrate Sox than a Sox website! So if you need a Sox pic fix, 
            we got you covered!
